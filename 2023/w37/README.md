# MakeoverMonday 2023 W37 - Average UK House Prices

## Data Source

The [Office of National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/housepriceindexmonthlyquarterlytables1to19) is a UK government agency focused on collecting and publishing data and statistics for the country. They are also in charge of conducting the census in England and Wales every 10 years.

## Data Cleaning

-  Removed the row for Q1 1992 in Excel since there were nulls for average house price, money borrowed, and buyer income. The cleaned dataset (saved as a CSV) will start at Q2 1992.
